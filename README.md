# Number Guesser
**Created by** Mandy Alford & Tanisha L. Davey

### Description:
This is a two player guessing game where each player tries to guess a random number generated by the computer. For each incorrect guess, the computer tells each player whether or not the number they guessed is higher or lower than the target number. When a player guesses the correct number, a "winner's card" is displayed detailing the two players, the winner of the game, the total number of guesses it took to arrive at the target number and the total time that lapsed between the start of the game (when a range was submitted) and the end of the game (correct guess submittal). This game was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
